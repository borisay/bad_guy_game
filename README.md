# bad_guy_game

Simple game for retired people. 
Just a shooting range with moving targets. Each miss adds another target. There is possibility to change number of targets and speed of moving.
This was a useful practice in JS. Try [this](https://borisay.github.io/test-area/bad-guy-game/index4.html).
